## AVIF

AVIF is the next step in image optimization based on the AV1 video codec. It is standardized by the
Alliance for Open Media. AVIF offers more compression gains than other image formats such as JPEG
and WebP. Our and other studies have shown that, depending on the content, encoding settings, and
quality target, you can save up to 50% versus JPEG or 20% versus WebP images. The advanced image
encoding feature of AVIF brings codec and container support for HDR and wide color gamut images,
film grain synthesis, and progressive decoding. AVIF support has improved significantly since Chrome
M85 implemented AVIF support last summer.
